# SceneKit-Experiments
3d planets with scenekit

A little demonstration of displacement of a geosphere, using 3 dimensional simplex noise to do away with deformation 
at the poles and seams found when texturing a lat/long based sphere. 

There is also some shader modifier stuff in there too.

(pan, zoom and rotate, double tap on an object to make it the cameras target.)
